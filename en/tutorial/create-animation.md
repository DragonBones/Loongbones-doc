# Creating Your First Animation

Now let's create an animation

## Switch to Animation Mode
1. Click the "Animation Mode" button at the top to switch the interface to animation mode. The "Timeline" interface will appear at the bottom.

## Create Keyframes

1. In the timeline interface, click at the position of frame 30 to move the playhead to the 30th frame.
2. Select a bone on the stage. A cross-shaped operation handle will appear.
3. Press and hold the red arrow of the operation handle, drag the mouse to the right, and then release the mouse. The bone will move to a new position.
4. At this point, keyframe markers appear at frames 0 and 30 on the timeline, with a line connecting the two keyframes.
5. Congratulations, you have created an animation.
6. Click the play button on the timeline to watch the animation effect.
