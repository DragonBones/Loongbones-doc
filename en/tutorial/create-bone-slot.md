# Creating Bones and Slots

When you successfully open the editor, you will see a point in the center of the stage. That is the default root bone. A skeleton has one and only one root bone.

## Creating Bones

1. Click on the second tool in the top right toolbar of the stage area, the "Create Bone Tool".
2. Since you must select a parent bone when creating a bone, the root bone is automatically selected at this point.
3. On the stage, in the empty area where you want to create a bone, click with your mouse, hold down the button, drag the mouse to extend the length of the bone, then release the mouse.
4. Congratulations! You have created your first bone.
5. After you have created a bone, that bone becomes selected. You can continue to create the next bone following step 3, allowing you to create a chain of bones.
6. If you want to create a new bone using another bone as the parent, you can click on that bone to select it. Then follow step 3 to create the bone.
7. After creating bones, click on the first tool in the top right toolbar of the stage area, the "Select and Edit Tool".

## Creating Slots

1. Currently the asset library is empty. First, find an image on your computer in PNG or JPG format.
2. Drag this image into the library panel. The image will appear under the images section in the library panel.
3. Select this image in the library panel, then drag it onto the stage. You can drag it over a bone, and when the bone highlights, release the mouse. This will create a slot attached to that bone.
4. If you drag it directly onto the stage without highlighting a bone, the slot will be created on the root bone.
5. Slots created using this method will automatically include an image as the slot's display resource.

Congratulations! You have learned how to create bones and slots.
