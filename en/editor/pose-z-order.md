# Adjusting Layer Order

The layer panel represents the stacking order of slots on the stage. The higher on the panel, the higher the layer. If slots overlap, the slot on the upper layer will cover the slot on the lower layer.

1. Adjust in the layer panel
2. Use the four buttons on the right side of the layer panel to adjust. The four buttons are: Move to Top Layer, Move to Bottom Layer, Move Up One Layer, Move Down One Layer.
3. Drag the slot you want to adjust in the layer panel to the appropriate position.

<br> Adjusting the layer order in animation mode allows you to add keyframes.
