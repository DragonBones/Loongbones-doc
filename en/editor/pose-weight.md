# Mesh Weight Adjustment

After binding bones to a mesh, the system automatically calculates weights once. If you're not satisfied with the weights, you can manually adjust the weight of each point for each bone.

## Editing Weights
1. Select a mesh that has bones bound to it.
2. Select the last tool, the **Edit Weight** tool, from the toolbar in the upper right corner of the stage.
3. The mesh points on the stage will change to circles with colored fan-shaped areas. Different colored fans correspond to different colored bones, indicating the control weight of bones on this point.
4. First select a point.
5. Then select a bone.
6. Hold the mouse in an empty area of the stage, then move upward to increase weight or downward to decrease weight. (It's recommended to only increase weight)
7. Alternatively, you can adjust the slider or enter a value in the properties panel to modify the weight.
8. Editing weights requires care and patience.
9. When finished, remember to switch back to the first tool, the selection tool, in the upper right corner of the stage.

## Automatic Weight
1. Select a mesh that has bones bound to it.
2. Select **Auto Weight** in the properties panel, and the system will automatically calculate the weights.
