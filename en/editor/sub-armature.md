# Sub-Armature

A sub-armature is a type of slot resource that is a complete armature, including bones, slots, and animations.
<br>
<br>
In LoongBones, you can create multiple armatures within a single project file.
<br>
<br>
You can place one or more armatures into slots of another armature and control the animation playback of the sub-armature on the timeline to create complex animations.
<br>
<br>
Note that armatures cannot be nested in a circular manner. For example, if armature A is a sub-armature of armature B, then armature B cannot be used as a sub-armature of armature A.
