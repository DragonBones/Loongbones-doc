The curve represents the speed of animation changes between two keyframes.
<br>When a keyframe is selected, the animation curve after this keyframe appears here.
<br>The animation curve can be a polyline, straight line, or a Bezier curve.
<br>Click on the curve to add points.
<br>Drag points or handles to modify the curve.
<br>Generally, the curve range is from 0-100, but it can exceed this range.
<br>The buttons below are preset curve buttons. Click them to quickly modify the curve.

1. Step: The animation curve is a polyline, indicating no transition; the animation will change abruptly.
2. Linear: A straight line, indicating uniform change
3. Ease In: Starts slow, then speeds up
4. Ease Out: Starts fast, then slows down
5. Ease In-Out: Starts slow, speeds up, then slows down again
6. Copy button: Copies the current animation curve.
7. Paste button: Pastes the copied animation curve.
