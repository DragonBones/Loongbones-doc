# Importing PSD Files

LoongBones supports importing PSD files generated by Photoshop.
<br>The PSD files supported by LoongBones can only contain layers, and layers can only be simple images. Various filters, masks, etc. are not supported.
<br>Before exporting PSD files from Photoshop, check the layers and naming. English naming is recommended.

1. Drag the PSD file onto the stage. If the PSD file format is correct, the import will be successful.
2. Each layer in the PSD will automatically create a slot with an image, positioned consistently with its location in the PSD file.
