# Stage Operations

The stage is a frequently used area, so scaling and panning the stage are common operations.

## Stage Scaling

1. Use the mouse wheel to scroll up and down to scale the stage. The stage will scale with the mouse position as the center point.
2. Click the number in the upper left corner to quickly restore the stage to 100% scale.

## Stage Movement

In the empty area of the stage (areas without bones and slots), hold down the **right mouse button** and drag the mouse to move the stage.
