# Animation Curve

Animation curves represent the speed of change between two keyframes.
<br>
If we compare keyframes to changes in position in physics, then animation curves represent changes in velocity, which is acceleration.
<br>
For example, a straight line animation curve indicates that the change is at a constant speed. Curved animation curves indicate acceleration or deceleration, or acceleration followed by deceleration, etc.

LoongBones supports the use of Bezier curves to express animation curves. Through these curves, rich animation effects can be expressed.
