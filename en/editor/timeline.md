# Timeline

The timeline is an essential part of animation. Since animation is the art of time, it's about images changing over time.
<br>
Therefore, the timeline expresses time as a progression that starts from 0 and continuously increases.
<br>
<br>
In LoongBones, time on the timeline is represented by frames and frame rate. Frame rate means how many frames are displayed in one second, for example, 30fps means 30 frames per second, and the smallest unit of the timeline is 1 frame.
You can add keyframes at any position on the timeline,
<br>
Keyframes record the values of bone and slot properties at a specific frame time.
<br>
Between two keyframes, property values can change automatically according to the animation curve.
<br>
Frames, frame rates, and keyframes together compose the timeline.
<br>
<br>
Generally, we call the change of one property over time a timeline, such as: position timeline, rotation timeline, free-form deformation timeline, etc.
<br>
Multiple timelines together form an animation.

In the LoongBones editor, timelines are displayed in the camera sheet panel.
