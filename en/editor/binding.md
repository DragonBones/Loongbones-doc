# Bone Binding-Skinning rigging

Bone binding is also called skinning. When we want to deform a mesh, if there are many points on the mesh, it's very troublesome to modify each point one by one to create free-form animation. In this case, we can use skinning animation to solve the problem.

Skinning is a technique that binds one or more bones to a mesh, allowing the changes of bones to drive the changes of mesh points to form an animation.

The operation of binding bones is generally called rigging in English.
