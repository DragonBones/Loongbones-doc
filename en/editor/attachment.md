# Slot Resources

Slot resources are things that can be placed inside slots.
<br>
Currently, LoongBones supports the following slot resources: images, meshes, linked meshes, bounding boxes, sub-armatures, and more types may be added in the future.
<br>
Among these slot resources, images, meshes, linked meshes, and sub-armatures are display objects that can be visually displayed. Bounding boxes are generally not displayed.
<br>
A slot can only have one slot resource displayed or in effect at any given moment.
