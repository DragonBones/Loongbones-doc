# Slot

Slots are parts controlled by bones. A slot must be and can only be controlled by one bone. The translation, rotation, and scaling of a bone will drive the changes in the slot's translation, rotation, and scaling.
<br>
A slot is a container that can hold one or more [slot resources](./attachment), but only one slot resource can be displayed at any given moment.
<br>
Slot properties include: position, angle, scale, color, transparency, and display object.
<br>
Among them, position, angle, and scale are relative to its bone.
<br>
Color and transparency only affect certain slot resources.
<br>
Display object indicates which slot resource is currently displayed by the slot.
