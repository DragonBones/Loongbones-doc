# Importing LoongBones Project Files

A LoongBones project file has a .dbproj extension and is generated by the DragonBonesPro editor.
<br>LoongBones project files contain armature, bone, slot, and slot resource data.
<br>LoongBones project files do not include image resources.
<br>It's recommended to import image resources into the library before importing the project file.

## Importing Project Files
1. Drag the .dbproj project file into the library panel to complete the import.
2. If images with the same names as those in the data exist in the library, the armature data and resource data will match up.
3. If the library doesn't have images that match the armature data, the images in the armature will be replaced with default "Missing" images.
4. You'll need to import the images and then use the slot property's resource replacement feature to replace the "Missing" images.
5. It's recommended to import image resources into the library before importing the project file.
