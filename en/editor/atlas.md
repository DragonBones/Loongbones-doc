# Texture Atlas/Sprite Sheet

A texture atlas is a collection of images. To save space and improve efficiency, different images are usually combined onto a single large image, with a configuration file explaining how many small images make up this large image, the size of each small image, and their position on the large image.
<br>
This type of material, consisting of one or more large images and a configuration file, is called a texture atlas.
<br>
A texture atlas is also called a sprite sheet, because the English word for sprite is "sprite".
<br>
LoongBones supports importing this type of texture atlas as one kind of resource library.
