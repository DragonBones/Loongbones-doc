- In the popup dialog, enter the name of the animation, and click the OK button to create a new animation.

## Switching Animations
- Click the animation name in the animation panel to switch the animation being edited.

## Deleting an Animation
- In the animation panel, when hovering the mouse over the animation name, a delete button will appear. Click the delete button to delete the animation.

## Copying an Animation
- In the animation panel, click the **Clone Animation** button. In the popup dialog, enter a new name to create an animation identical to the current one.
